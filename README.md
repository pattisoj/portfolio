# Tech stack explanation

For my personal portfolio I wanted to take the time to try new things. I felt it was the perfect opportunity to improve myself as a software developer in my own time away from the School of Code. For this reason I chose a brand new framework, a new deployment tool and a CSS library.
<br />
<br />
I chose next.js for a couple of main reasons, the first and most obvious was the fact it was new to me and therefore I could take more away from it. Second of all it used a different structure to create react app. It's use of pages and lack of a html document offered me a new experience and the best opportunity for me to cross compare my preferences between the two. The final main reason for picking next.js comes from my deployment decision.
<br />
<br />
I chose Vercel for two main reasons. Much simpler than choosing a framework I chose Vercel because it was something I had never used and it works perfectly with next.js, which inturn swayed me toward next.js itself.
<br />
<br />
I didn't want to stop with just a new framework and a new method of deployment. So I chose to use a CSS library. We had used UI libraries for react at the bootcamp before and I could see possible pros and cons. One con specifically was the rigidity of them. So, my thought was that a CSS library might offer some more flexibility whilst bringing some of the pros of UI/component library. I chose Tailwind as I had researched it before and it paired well with next.js.

# Inspiration/Design explanation

I wanted to create a portfolio using various styles and inspirations to best show off my personality. I also want to show a range of techniques all in one place. For each page I am going to break down my inspirations and my reasoning.

## Homepage and Components

Both my homepage and the consistent components (_the navbar, logo-bar, page number and the date/time/cursor tracker_) all come from the same sources of inspiration. For these my inspiration comes from various software developer portfolios. This is mainly the structure of the page but also the way the text is displayed on the homepage, one example would be [Brittany Chiang's Portfolio](https://brittanychiang.com/).
<br />
<br />
The look of the homepage comes from some of my favourite clothes designers; [Virgil Abloh](https://www.off---white.com/en-gb/) (specifically OFF-WHITE for this portfolio), [Maison Margiela](https://www.maisonmargiela.com/en-gb/), [Gosha Rubchinskiy](http://gosharubchinskiy.com/) and [Issey Miyake](https://www.isseymiyake.com/en/). I wanted the page to almost feel like a piece of art, or part of an art gallery. I certainly don't know a lot about art but a do enjoy it, another source of inspiration for this page comes from art and I would say one of my favourite ways to view it is with fine art restoration heres an example: [Baumgartner Restoration](https://www.youtube.com/c/BaumgartnerRestoration).
<br />

#### Homepage/Component Takeaway -

I used Tailwind CSS to style the components of this portfolio and also the homepage. It was very easy to use and I thought the documentation was great. However, as my code base begins to increase and I look to move on to my about page I feel I will need to make some changes. I don't like the _look_ of my code with Tailwind, it feels really bloated within the HTML. I intend to keep the Tailwind as it is on my homepage as a reminder of my learning experience.
