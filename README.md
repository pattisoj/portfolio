## Tech stack explanation -

For my personal portfolio I wanted to take the time to try new things. I felt it was the perfect opportunity to improve myself as a software developer in my own time away from the School of Code. For this reason I chose a brand new framework, a new deployment tool and a CSS library.
<br />
<br />
I chose next.js for a couple of main reasons, the first and most obvious was the fact it was new to me and therefore I could take more away from it. Second of all it used a different structure to create react app. It's use of pages and lack of a html document offered me a new experience and the best opportunity for me to cross compare my preferences between the two. The final main reason for picking next.js comes from my deployment decision.
<br />
<br />
I chose Vercel for two main reasons. Much simpler than choosing a framework I chose Vercel because it was something I had never used and it works perfectly with next.js, which inturn swayed me toward next.js itself.
<br />
<br />
I didn't want to stop with just a new framework and a new method of deployment. So I chose to use a CSS library. We had used UI libraries for react at the bootcamp before and I could see possible pros and cons. One con specifically was the rigidity of them. So, my thought was that a CSS library might offer some more flexibility whilst bringing some of the pros of UI/component library. I chose Tailwind as I had researched it before and it paired well with next.js.
