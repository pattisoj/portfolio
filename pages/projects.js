                      I created this NPM package as a learning opportunity.

                    <br />I wanted to experience and learn about the creation of
                    a public package.
                    <br /> I also wanted to{" "}
                    <mark>learn about CI/CD pipelines</mark> and this project
                    was my first experience of it. I was able to create a GitHub
                    workflow that runs all tests on a push or pull request and
                    if they pass is able to automatically publish to npm if the
                    version is updated! This facilitated the addition of a CI/CD
                    pipeline to my final project where I additionally
                    experimented with running ESLint on a pull request!

                    I chose a string manipulation package as I felt it gave me
                    the most opportunities to keep adding functionality. I wrote
                    all of the methods and tests in the library and all of the

                    The brief for this project was <ins>brief</ins> (no pun
                    intended!). We had to simply identify and solve a problem
                    using technology.

                  <br />
                  <mark>The Problems & Our Solution</mark>
                  <p>
                    So what problems did we find? The problem this app aimed to
                    solve can be split into two sections:{" "}
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <ins>Too much information</ins>
                  <p>
                    During our consumer research, before app creation, we found
                    that consumers were overwhelmed by all of the information
                    out there when they were trying to book a holiday. They had
                    way too many tabs open and felt they had to hold a lot of
                    information between webpages to inform their decision We set
                    out to solve this by creating an app that could store all
                    the information you would need in one place. This is the
                    first purpose of FINDERS KEEPERS.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <ins> Profit influenced information</ins>
                  <p>
                    Whilst doing our research to source the best information for
                    our new application we discovered a second problem; profit
                    influenced the information websites provided. We found that
                    websites seemed to avoid tougher topics like crime or
                    possible negatives to travel in order to sell you their
                    travel guides for example.
                  </p>

                    {`
                    This gave us a unique opportunity. We didn't need to make
                    profit. We decided to take this as a bonus and focus on showing the
                    truthful information - unedited and unbiased. To achieve
                    this we didn't cherry pick our information and decided to
                    display it to users as is. Giving our users full confidence
                    in our information.`}

                    Create a class that contained the following methods:
                    deposit, withdraw, get_balance, transfer and check_funds.
                    When the budget object is printed it should display: A title
                    line of 30 characters where the name of the category is
                    centred in a line of * characters. A list of the items in
                    the ledger. Each line should show the description and
                    amount. The first 23 characters of the description should be
                    displayed, then the amount. The amount should be right
                    aligned, contain two decimal places, and display a maximum
                    of 7 characters. A line displaying the category total.

                    In this project you will use object oriented programming to
                    create a Rectangle class and a Square class. The Square
                    class should be a subclass of Rectangle and inherit methods
                    and attributes.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    When a Rectangle object is created, it should be initialized
                    with width and height attributes. The class should also
                    contain various additional methods (such as
                    get_amount_inside).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When a Square object is created a single side length is
                    passed in. The __init__ method should store the side length
                    in both the width and height attributes from the Rectangle
                    class. The Square class should be able to access the
                    Rectangle class methods but should also contain a set_side
                    method.

                    Suppose there is a hat containing 5 blue balls, 4 red balls,
                    and 2 green balls. What is the probability that a random
                    draw of 4 balls will contain at least 1 red ball and 2 green
                    balls? While it would be possible to calculate the
                    probability using advanced mathematics, an easier way is to
                    write a program to perform a large number of experiments to
                    estimate an approximate probability. For this project, you
                    will write a program to determine the approximate
                    probability of drawing certain balls randomly from a hat.
