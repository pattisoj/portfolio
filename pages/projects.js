                      I created this NPM package as a learning opportunity.

                    <br />I wanted to experience and learn about the creation of
                    a public package.
                    <br /> I also wanted to{" "}
                    <mark>learn about CI/CD pipelines</mark> and this project
                    was my first experience of it. I was able to create a GitHub
                    workflow that runs all tests on a push or pull request and
                    if they pass is able to automatically publish to npm if the
                    version is updated! This facilitated the addition of a CI/CD
                    pipeline to my final project where I additionally
                    experimented with running ESLint on a pull request!

                    I chose a string manipulation package as I felt it gave me
                    the most opportunities to keep adding functionality. I wrote
                    all of the methods and tests in the library and all of the

                    The brief for this project was <ins>brief</ins> (no pun
                    intended!). We had to simply identify and solve a problem
                    using technology.

                  <br />
                  <mark>The Problems & Our Solution</mark>
                  <p>
                    So what problems did we find? The problem this app aimed to
                    solve can be split into two sections:{" "}
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <ins>Too much information</ins>
                  <p>
                    During our consumer research, before app creation, we found
                    that consumers were overwhelmed by all of the information
                    out there when they were trying to book a holiday. They had
                    way too many tabs open and felt they had to hold a lot of
                    information between webpages to inform their decision We set
                    out to solve this by creating an app that could store all
                    the information you would need in one place. This is the
                    first purpose of FINDERS KEEPERS.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <ins> Profit influenced information</ins>
                  <p>
                    Whilst doing our research to source the best information for
                    our new application we discovered a second problem; profit
                    influenced the information websites provided. We found that
                    websites seemed to avoid tougher topics like crime or
                    possible negatives to travel in order to sell you their
                    travel guides for example.
                  </p>

                    {`
                    This gave us a unique opportunity. We didn't need to make
                    profit. We decided to take this as a bonus and focus on showing the
                    truthful information - unedited and unbiased. To achieve
                    this we didn't cherry pick our information and decided to
                    display it to users as is. Giving our users full confidence
                    in our information.`}

                    Create a function that receives a list of strings that are
                    arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged
                    vertically and side-by-side. The function should optionally
                    take a second argument. When the second argument is set to
                    True, the answers should be displayed.
